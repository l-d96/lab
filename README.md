# lab

**lab** is a quick way to spin up throwaway files for rapid experimenting. No more fuss about filenames or folders—just type `lab js` (or any extension) and start coding instantly in your editor. All files are auto-named (e.g., `250112a.js`) and live in a `lab` folder. By default, they vanish after 7 days, keeping things tidy.

## Features

- **Experiment**: `lab <letters>` creates and opens a fresh file (e.g., `lab js`).  
- **Revisit**: `lab <numbers>` reopens recent files (e.g., `lab 1`, `lab 2`).  
- **Clean Up**: Files expire automatically after 7 days (configurable).  
- **List**: Just run `lab` to see your files, newest first.  

Focus on experimenting and trying out ideas without distractions—**lab** simplifies the process so you can start coding immediately.
